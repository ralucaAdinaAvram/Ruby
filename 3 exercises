Looping with 'While'



Use a while loop to print out the numbers 1 through 50, inclusive. 
While the example above counts down, you will want to count up.
Use print rather than puts, and donâ€™t forget to increment your variable.
=begin




i=1
while i<=50 do
print i
i +=1
end


=begin
Looping with 'Until'


=begin

i = 3
while i > 0 do
  print i
  i -= 1
end
 
j = 3
until j == 0 do
  print j
  j -= 1
end





=begin
Looping with 'For'
=end

for i in 1..50
print i
end


=begin
Exercise
Use the loop iterator to print out the string "Ruby!" 30 times.
=end

i = 0
loop do
  print "Ruby!"
  i += 1
  break if i == 30
end


# Iterating with .times
30.times { print "Ruby!" }
